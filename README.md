## Marketing Strategies
### Digital Media Needs
In order to meet the digital media needs of Bespoke Stables they intend to utilise a number of e-marketing tools, such as social media, search engine optimisation, email marketing and online advertising. 

#### Social Media
*   Social media is a huge platform for businesses as it generates a wide reach.
*   Almost everyone is on some form of social media be it Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
*   It is also free to use but you have the option to boost posts by paying a fee.
*   It is important to post frequently on social media which some may find difficult to do.
*   This is why e-tools such as Buffer and Hootsuite can come in handy. These are post scheduling sites where you can organize posts for different media sites and choose when you want them to go live.
*   It is also important to create content that includes an image to grab people’s attention.
*   Text alone is not enough to make people pay attention to your post.

##### Advantages
*   Large Audiences - Facebook has 1.13 billion users, Twitter has 313 million monthly active users, Instagram has 500 million, and Pinterest has about 110 million.
*   Free to create - One of the biggest advantages of social media marketing is that it is entirely free to businesses.
*   Encourage sharing - People love to share things with their networks, from photos and recipes to interesting articles and hot deals.

#### Email Marketing
Email Marketing allows you to send newsletters and announcements to subscribers by the mass.
Once someone subscribers to the newsletter, Bespoke Equestrian can use an e-tool such as Mail Chimp,  keep all their subscribers email addresses and send the email to everyone.

##### Advantages
*   Flexible design - can send plain text, graphics or attach files - whichever suits.
*   Scalable - used to reach large audience or smaller targeted lists
*   Sharable - it’s easy for people to forward, building your reputation by word of mouth or viral marketing.
*   Measurable - easy to attribute value to a campaign by using web analytics software.
*   Cost effective - can be much lower than many other forms of marketing
*   Time saving - through automation you can trigger emails to be sent to users based on an action they have performed on your website

#### Search Engine Optimisation
Search Engine Optimisation is an important part of Digital Marketing as it allows your website or Social Media page to be seen.
*   To keep an eye on how your pages are doing in terms of SEO, e-tools such as Google Analytics, Google Page Speed Insights and Google Web Master Tools can be used to see what is working well and what needs to be improved.
*   On these you can view what region or country the majority of your page views are from as well as how long each visitor stays on your page.
*   If they are leaving quickly, the reason could be that your page loads slowly. People do not like having to wait more than 3 seconds for a page to load.

##### Advantages
* by Consumers – When they search for a particular product or service, they trust that the top result is the best one. This is not necessarily the case, but the top result does have some very good search engine marketing thanks to this assumption.
*   Trackable – search engine marketing allows you to see just what is and isn’t working.
*   Targeted Traffic – The traffic you receive to your website from a search engine is made up of users who searched for applicable search terms related to your business. This is much more productive than meaningless hits that will not turn into sale
